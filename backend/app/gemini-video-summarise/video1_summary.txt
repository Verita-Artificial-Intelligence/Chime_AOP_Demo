### Text Summary of User Actions

1.  The user starts by reviewing the "Consumer Information ACDV Response" form.
2.  They switch to the "Penny" application tab, search for the member using their account number, and click on the result to view the member's details.
3.  Returning to the ACDV form, they enable editing by unchecking a box. They then proceed to verify the member's personal information (First Name, Last Name, Middle Name, SSN, Date of Birth, Telephone Number, and Address) by comparing it to the "Penny" record and selecting "Same," "Unknown," or typing in the correct information in the corresponding response fields.
4.  After verifying all personal information, the user clicks "Continue" to move to the "Account Information" section.
5.  They navigate to the "Credit" section in the "Penny" tab and then to the "Metro2 Staging Data" tab to look up the member's data using their ID.
6.  The user checks for delinquency by searching for "delinq" in the member's notes in "Penny".
7.  They then go to the "Transactions" tab, filter by date, and identify the last payment amount and date.
