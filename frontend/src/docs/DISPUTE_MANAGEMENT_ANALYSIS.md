# Dispute Management Analysis

## Current Implementation

The dispute management system is **already properly integrated** with the workflow endpoints. Here's how it works:

### 1. Dispute Submission Flow (DisputesPage.tsx)

**With File Upload**:
1. User submits dispute form with attached file
2. Calls `DisputeApiService.uploadSOP(file)` â†’ `POST /workflow/upload_sop`
3. Backend processes SOP and returns `workflowRunId` and `disputeCode`
4. User gets notification with workflow run ID
5. Can view dispute in history tab

**Without File Upload**:
1. Currently simulated with timeout (placeholder)
2. **RECOMMENDATION**: Create dedicated endpoint for text-only disputes

### 2. Dispute Management Actions

**Retry Dispute**: 
- Uses `DisputeApiService.executeWorkflowAction("start", disputeId)`
- Maps to `POST /workflow/action?action=start&workflowRunId={id}`

**View Details**: 
- Currently just logs to console
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Navigate to Active Runs page with workflow ID

### 3. Workflow Controls (WorkflowControls.tsx)

Already properly integrated with backend:
- **Status Polling**: `GET /workflow/status?workflowRunId={id}`
- **Start/Pause/Resume**: `POST /workflow/action?action={action}&workflowRunId={id}`
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- Real-time status updates

### 4. Integration Points

**âœ… PROPERLY INTEGRATED**:
- SOP file upload â†’ workflow creation
- Workflow action controls (start/pause/resume)
- Status polling and updates
- Email notifications via `POST /workflow/email`
- Slack notifications via `POST /workflow/slack`

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Complete Dispute History Integration

**Current Issue**: Dispute history likely uses mock data or localStorage

**Solution**: 
```typescript
// Add to DisputeApiService
static async getDisputeHistory(userId?: string): Promise<DisputeRecord[]> {
  // Call backend API to get user's dispute history
  // Should return list of disputes with their workflow status
}
```

### 2. Text-Only Dispute Submission

**Current Issue**: Disputes without files are simulated

**Solution**: Create dedicated endpoint
```
POST /workflow/create_dispute
{
  "disputeType": "text",
  "description": "...",
  "disputantInfo": {...}
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Dispute Details View

**Current Issue**: "View Details" just logs to console

**Solution**: Navigate to workflow details
```typescript
const handleViewDetails = (dispute: DisputeRecord) => {
  navigate(`/workflow/active-runs?id=${dispute.workflowRunId}`);
};
```

### 4. Dispute Status Synchronization

**Current Issue**: Dispute status might not sync with workflow status

**Solution**: 
- Ensure dispute records are updated when workflow status changes
- Add webhook or polling to sync dispute status with workflow status

## API Endpoints Already in Use

### âœ… Currently Integrated
- `POST /workflow/upload_sop` - SOP file upload
- `POST /workflow/action` - Workflow actions (start/pause/resume)
- `GET /workflow/status` - Get workflow status
- `POST /workflow/email` - Send email notifications
- `POST /workflow/slack` - Send Slack notifications

### ðŸŸ¡ Partially Integrated
- Dispute history (likely needs backend endpoint)
- Text-only dispute creation

### ðŸ”´ Missing but Recommended
- `GET /disputes/history` - Get user's dispute history
- `POST /disputes/create` - Create text-only dispute
- `PUT /disputes/{id}/status` - Update dispute status
- `GET /disputes/{id}/details` - Get dispute details

## Conclusion

**The dispute management system is already well-integrated with the workflow API endpoints.** The main workflow functionality (file upload, status tracking, action controls) properly uses the backend API.

**Key Strengths**:
- SOP upload creates real workflows
- Workflow controls are fully functional
- Status polling works correctly  
- Notifications are integrated

**Areas for Enhancement**:
- Complete dispute history API integration
- Add text-only dispute creation
- Improve dispute details view
- Ensure status synchronization

**Priority**: LOW - The core functionality is working correctly with the API. Enhancements are nice-to-have but not critical for the current demo.
